# Hello, World! 🌍

Greetings from the bustling city of **Shanghai**! I'm a middle school student with a passion for all things **math** and **programming**. If numbers were a language, I'd be fluent in *Pi* and *Binary*!

## My Interests 🎉

- **Math**: You could say I have a *calculating* personality! I love solving problems faster than you can say "Pythagorean theorem." 
- **Programming**: When I’m not busy crunching numbers, I’m busy crunching code. My favorite programming language? Well, it’s a *byte* of everything!
- **Table Tennis**: I play table tennis like I solve math problems—quickly and with a lot of *spin*! 🏓

## A Little About Me 🌟

- **Zodiac Sign**: I'm a proud *Libra*! Balancing equations and friendships is my forte. Just call me the *Scales of Justice*.
- **MBTI**: I’m an **ESTP**—the *Entrepreneur*! I thrive on excitement and love to take risks. If there’s a challenge, I’m already halfway there!

## Fun Facts 🤓

- I can calculate the trajectory of a table tennis ball while simultaneously debugging my code. Talk about multitasking!
- My friends say I’m like a math problem: a bit complex, but ultimately rewarding once you figure me out! 

## Conclusion 🎈

So, if you ever need help with math homework, a programming project, or just want to challenge me to a game of table tennis, you know where to find me! Let’s make learning fun and *smash* those challenges together! 

Thanks for reading, and remember: **Stay curious, stay awesome!** 😄
